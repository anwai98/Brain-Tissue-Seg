# Brain-Tissue-Seg
Brain Tissue Segmentation on MRI Images

Dataset used - IBSR18

How to play with the codes?

1. Use the Colab Notebooks for 2D Pipelines of UNet, ResUNet, DenseUNet, nnUNet likewise according to your utility/requirement. This will segment the three tissues of the Brain MRI Images - CSF, White Matter and Gray Matter. 
2. Play with the straight forward code. You must remember to read the documentations of nnUNet (https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet) and versions of UNet (https://github.com/ashishpatel26/satellite-Image-Semantic-Segmentation-Unet-Tensorflow-keras) from these repositories.
